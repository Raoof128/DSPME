# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! This project aims to model production-grade DSPM practices. To keep quality high:

1. **Discuss changes** via issue or PR description before large work.
2. **Set up environment** with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and optional `pre-commit install`.
3. **Run checks**: `ruff check`, `ruff format`, and `pytest` must pass.
4. **Add tests** for new logic or bug fixes.
5. **Document** new features in README or `docs/` where appropriate.
6. **Security first**: avoid logging secrets, prefer least-privilege defaults, and include hardening guidance when touching cloud integrations.

By submitting a PR you agree to the Code of Conduct and certify that you have the right to contribute the code under the project license.
